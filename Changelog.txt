ED AFK Monitor Changelog
------------------------

WIP
---
- Config profiles are auto-loaded if a matching commander name is found
- Monitor now waits for first game load before completing startup
- Option 'ThreadCmdrNames' for commander name in thread titles (@Conshmea #12)
- Argument '--setfile' to load specific journal file (@Conshmea #13)

v250904
-------
- Real-time monitoring of kill rate and interval for improved warnings of dead or poor instances
  - At the start of a new instance warn if 5 minutes pass without any kills
  - Warn if the hourly kill rate average drops below the configured amount
  - Warn if there have been no kills for the configured number of minutes
- Real-time window title updating (Windows OS only)
  - Kills per hour are now live and based on deploy time (=more accurate)
  - Addition of elapsed time since previous kill
- Reporting of merits gained from kills (log level 'Merits', default 0)
- Improved error messages (that you hopefully won't see)

v250701
-------
- Report estimated time fuel will last on fuel messages
- New log level 'FuelReport' (default: 1) reports fuel info regardless of amount remaining
- Enable reporting of kills, bonds (and merits if powerplay) at combat zones
- Don't send journal inactivity warnings unless deployed for combat

v250610
-------
- Add update checker
- Fix ship difficulty identification for non-English languages
- Fix Discord test mode during preloading
- Fix failure to suppress duplicate Discord bait fail messages

v250527
-------
- New 'ExtendedStats' setting adds:
  - Number of session kills on kill events
  - Average kill rate for last 10 kills on session reports
  - Count of session bait fails on bait fail events
- Added commander rank and rank progress to load event
- Added Changelog.txt (wait, that's this!)

v250506
-------
- Discord forum channel / thread support
  - To enable: WebhookURL must point to a forum channel (instead of a regular text channel) and ForumChannel must be set to true
  - Default settings assume a regular channel, so no changes are needed to continue using text channels as before
- Switched to using discord-webhook library (only relevant for those using the Python version)

v250412
-------
- Journal preloading on startup
  - Journal is read from start to end and events logged to terminal as usual
  - New argument --resetsession resets session stats after preload (useful for experimenting within a single instance)
  - Missions completed/remaining and fuel capacity should now always be accurate
- Preloading also allows completed recent sessions to be output in full using the --fileselect argument

v230329
-------
- Optional argument --fileselect presents list of recent journals (with the commander names) to chose from
- Added tracking and reporting of powerplay merits - uses log level SummaryMerits (@Narcil)

v250325
-------
- (Windows only) Track mission stack progress and hourly kill rate in window title
windowtitle
- Track total kills and total bounty stats across instances and output on script shutdown (uses existing log levels SummaryKills & SummaryBounties)
- Log security ship scans (log level SecurityScan, default 2)
  - This is an early-warning system for hostile (aggroed) security, assuming your fighter is still around to scan them - will also trigger on any manual scans so it's recommended to avoid scanning security (use a keybind for hostile targets only), or set level 0 to disable these logs
- Log messages indicating attack by security ships (log level SecurityAttack, default 3)
  - These messages occur only when security scan you and you already have a fine or bounty, however they may come too late compared to SecurityScan so it's recommended to have both on for earlier warning
- New default avatar for web hook / icon for standalone .exe version (credit to CMDR Qohen Leth)
- Faction names are now off on kill messages by default. Set BountyFaction = true in Settings to restore
- Added descriptions to all the log levels

v250311
-------
- Optional logging of session bounty values in summary; total value, average/kill and average/hour are included, controlled by log level SummaryBounties (default: 1)
- Optional addition of bounty value to kill logs (BountyValue), plus faction name is also now optional (BountyFaction)
- Send a warning when there has been no journal activity for x minutes (default 15). Controlled by new settings InactivityMax for minutes and log level Inactivity
- Log level Reports has been renamed SummaryKills for consistency with above

v250307
-------
- Track number of active missions: These are now shown when the kills are completed for a mission, e.g. 1/20 for the first of a full stack. This information is only available on game load so loading or relogging while the monitor is running is required, otherwise completed missions are presented as in previous versions
- Include ship type and game mode on game load/relog
- T10 added to list of hard ships (*really* rare spawn in hard instances)
- Handle journal parsing errors such as empty lines
- Only check messages received from NPCs (this prevents players from triggering "Pirate bait value too low" messages for anyone running AFK Monitor)
- Updated check for stolen cargo for greater accuracy

v250220
-------
- A name and avatar is now sent for the webhook by default (can be disabled in config to use settings in Discord)
- New kills/hour setting for increasing the 'Reports' log level when kills/hour drop below threshold (i.e. ping on low kill rate)
- Fix for unexpected characters in in-game chat causing script to stop

v250212
-------
- Config profiles: Every config setting can now be stored under additional profiles and loaded via the -p <name> argument. E.g. create a new config section called [MyAltProfile] and add Discord.WebhookURL = "<webhook>" to it then pass -p MyAltProfile via command line or shortcut to use that webhook. Only overrides need to be defined, all others default to the main settings

v250211
-------
- Command line arguments for passing journal folder, webhook and number of missions to use for MissionsAll
- New log level MissionsAll and related setting, defaults to ping on 20 mission completions
- More robust journal name checking to prevent loading of e.g. legacy journals (thanks @skywalker-elite)
- Alternate f-string quote types (prevents fail in Python versions before 3.12)

v250207.1
---------
- Handle errors and continue when sending webhook messages
- Fix log level = 0 not working correctly

v250206
-------
- Timestamps on Discord messages can now be disabled via config
- Make paths OS-agnostic (@IndorilReborn in #2)

v250205
-------
- First release
